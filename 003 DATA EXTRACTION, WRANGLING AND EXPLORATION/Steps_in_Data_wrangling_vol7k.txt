
Playing around with the dataset (Data wrangling and EDA)

1) Read the dataset in R using read.csv, read.xlsx etc or scrap datasets from the website. Knowledge of data types - Static/Dynamic/Hard/Soft/Structured/Un-structured

2) Understand the dataset very clearly - how many rows and columns does it have. Use the commands in R such as dim, class,
   nrow, ncol, head, tail, names, str and summary that will help in understanding better.

3) Do data manipulation operations such as filter, subset, aggregate, table, apply, dplyr packages etc. with the dataset.

4) Understand missing values and techniques to encounter them.

5) Play with data visualizations and do EDA using R packages such as ggplot2 - univariate & bivariate analysis

7) Some tidbits on normalization techniques such as log, exponential, sqrt etc.
