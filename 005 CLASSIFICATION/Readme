Module 5: Classification Assignment

Analyze the information given in the Affairs dataset and create classifiers using it.
The dataset can be loaded into R using the library:
➢ library(AER)

The description of the attributes in the dataset are as follows:

• affairs        –   numeric. How often engaged in extramarital sexual intercourse during the past year
• gender         –   Factor indicating gender.
• age            –   numeric variable coding age in years
• yearsmarried   –   numeric variable coding number of years married 0.125 = 3 months or less, 0.417 = 4–6 months,
                     0.75 = 6 months–1 year, 1.5 = 1–2 years, 4 = 3–5 years, 7 = 6–8 years, 10 = 9–11 years, 15 = 12 or more years.
• religiousness  –   numeric variable coding religiousness: 1 = anti, 2 = not at all, 3 = slightly, 4 = somewhat, 5 = very.
• Education      -   numeric variable coding level of education: 9 = grade school, 12 = high school graduate,
                      14 = some college, 16 = college graduate, 17 = some graduate work, 18 = master's degree, 20 = Ph.D., M.D.,
                      or other advanced degree.

Perform the following tasks on the dataset:

Task 1:  Using the affairs column of our data
          Create a new column with nominal values “YES” and “NO”.
          Convert it into factor

Task 2:  Create a classifier with our data using Decision tree algorithm
          Plot the Decision tree
          Calculate the accuracy using confusion matrix

Task 3:  Create another classifier with our data using random forest algorithm
          Calculate the accuracy using confusion matrix
          Find out the importance of attributes using importance() function
