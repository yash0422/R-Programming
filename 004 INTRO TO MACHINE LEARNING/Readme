Module 4: Introduction to Machine Learning
Assignment

Linear Regression:
Analyze the information given in the Video_games dataset and predict the values using linear regression model.

The description of the attributes in the dataset are as follows:
  • Name of the video game – text, each row depicts name of the video game
  • Platform – platform on which game runs.
  • NA_Sales – numeric variable, sales in North America for the respective games.
  • EU_Sales – numeric variable, sales in Europe for the respective games.
  • JP_Sales – numeric variable, sales in Japan for the respective games.
  • Other_Sales – numeric variable, aggregate sum of sales in other parts of the world, for the respective games.

Perform the following tasks on the dataset

Task 1: Using the sales columns of our data
  → Create a test set and training set
  → Create a new linear regression model using train set.
  → Predict the values for other sales for the test

Task 2: Plot the values predicted by our model and the actual values to check deviation between them
  → Create a subset of 100 values so that you can see the plot clearly
  → Plot the actual values from the test set in black
  → And plot the predicted values in red so that we can differentiate between them clearly.

Logistic Regression:

Analyze the information given in the Employee_Data dataset and predict the values using logistic regression model.

The description of the attributes in the dataset are as follows:
  • Edu_of_Emp – gives the education level of the employees
  • marital_satus – gives whether one is single, married, separated, divorced, or widowed. • Occ_of_Emp – give the occupation of employees like manager, cleaner, professor etc.
  • Emp_rel_status – gives the relation status of the employee like Husband, wife, not in family.
  • Work_hour_in_week – gives the number of hours the employee worked in a week.
  • Emp_sal – gives the salary range, >50k or<=50k
  
Perform the following tasks on the dataset

Task 1: Using the Emp_sal column of our data create a logistic regression model
  → Create a test set and training set
  → Build a model using all other columns and predict the values.
  → Create a confusion matrix with cut off value as 0.4
